# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
#puts 5
#puts 2

#puts 5+2
# Non-numbers

#puts "Hello World!"

puts "Tacos are " *3

# True, False

puts 3 == 2


# Nothing

# Variables

y = 3
x = "Hello"

puts x
puts y


# Combine strings and variables

puts "#{y} World!"

# String manipulation
